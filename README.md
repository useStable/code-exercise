# Stable | Code Exercise

For this exercise, you'll implement a simple web application for users to view physical mail they've recently received at a Stable facility. Once the web application is complete, you'll deploy it for anyone with the public url to view.

This exercise should take 2 - 4 hours to complete. 

### Business Requirements

* Users can click through multiple pages when there are more than 6 mail items to display
* Users can easily interact with the web application in all screen sizes
* The mock mail item data provided in the data.json file is served to the frontend via an endpoint
* The codebase is pushed to a remote repository
